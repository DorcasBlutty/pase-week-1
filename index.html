      <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change describes a change in the average weather condition such
        as temperature, pricipitation and humidityof a particular geographical
        area over a long period of time like 30 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Climate change has a greater impact on countries that are most reliant
        on natural resources and/or who have the least capacity to repond
        tonatural hazards such as floods and droughts. Women commonly face
        higher risks and greater burdens from the impacts in situations of
        poverty and majority of the world's poor are women Women's unequal
        participation in the decision making process and labour markets compound
        inequalities and often prevent women from fully contributing to climate
        related planning, policy-making and implementation.
